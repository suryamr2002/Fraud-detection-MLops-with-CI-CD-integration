# 🔍 Teaching:
# minReplicas: 2 - Always keep at least 2 pods for HA
# maxReplicas: 10 - Can scale up to 10 pods under load
# CPU target: 70% - Scale up if average CPU > 70%
# Memory target: 80% - Scale up if average memory > 80%
# scaleDown: Wait 5 min, reduce by 50% max per minute
# scaleUp: Scale immediately, can double pods or add 2 pods every 30s
